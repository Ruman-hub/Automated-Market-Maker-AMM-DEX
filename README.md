# Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEX

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
This project implements a simple decentralized exchange (DEX) using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. It allows users to swap between two ERC20 tokens, provide liquidity to the pool, and withdraw it later along with earned fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To create a transparent, efficient, and decentralized trading environment that eliminates intermediaries and promotes permissionless finance through automated token exchanges.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Liquidity Provision**: Users can add or remove liquidity to a token pair pool.
- **Token Swapping**: Enables seamless token exchange using the x * y = k AMM formula.
- **Fee Distribution**: 0.3% of each trade is retained in the pool to benefit liquidity providers.
- **Security**: Protected against reentrancy and input manipulation.
- **Event Logs**: Transparent tracking of all swaps and liquidity movements.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- **Multi-token Pools**: Support for more token pairs and dynamic pool creation.
- **Governance**: Introduce governance tokens to vote on upgrades and fee structures.
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Improve scalability with rollups or sidechains.
- **Yield Farming**: Incentivize users with farming rewards.
- **UI/Frontend Integration**: Build a React-based frontend to interact with the smart contract.
